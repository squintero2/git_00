## First Verse 
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Lewis Carrol in this section!-->
How doth the little crocodile   
Improve his shining tail,   
And pour the waters of the Nile   
On every golden scale!   
  
  
  
## Second Verse
<!--Put the first five lines of a poem by Robert Frost here!-->
And both that morning equally lay  
In leaves no step had trodden black  
Oh, I kept the first for another day!  
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,  
I doubted if I should ever come back 




## Third Verse
<!--Put the first two verses of The Walrus and the Carpenter here!-->
The sun was shining on the sea,
Shining with all his might:
He did his very best to make
The billows smooth and bright—
And this was odd, because it was
The middle of the night.
The moon was shining sulkily,
Because she thought the sun
Had got no business to be there
After the day was done—
"It's very rude of him," she said,
"To come and spoil the fun!"

## Last Verse
<!--Put a short poem of your choice 8-20 lines,here!-->
